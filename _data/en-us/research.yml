    Ecology and microbiology seemed to be concepts that had nothing in common for 
    several decades, and the field of microbial ecology took a long time to 
    emerge and consolidate. This was largely due to the lack of tools and technologies 
    to explore this field. However, with the development of technologies, algorithms 
    and methodologies that allow the simultaneous study of all (micro)organisms present 
    in an environment at a specific time, in the last decade it has been possible to 
    study microorganisms and their interactions together in what is now known as 
    meta-omics sciences.
    <br><br>
    Initially metagenomics allowed us to access the composition and genetic potential 
    of environments, later transcriptomics allowed us to approach gene expression in 
    those environments and now with proteomics and metabolomics we can begin to 
    understand the different interactions between members of a community. However, all 
    these techniques have developed quite rapidly and the technologies and algorithms 
    for the analysis and interpretation of these data have evolved more in response 
    to the particular needs of research groups than in a rational thinking to optimize 
    the use of data and resources, taking advantage of the advances in computing 
    capabilities that are currently available.

    The human gut microbiota is the set of all organisms living in the human 
    gastrointestinal tract. This amazingly diverse community is composed of 
    the 3 domains of life and their respective viruses. Since the emergence 
    of molecular techniques for the study of microbial communities, the gut 
    microbiota has been a major target of study and large consortia such as 
    the HMP in the USA and MetaHIT in Europe have devoted a great deal of 
    resources to characterize these communities. However, the major effort 
    to study these communities has been made on their prokaryotic component 
    ignoring for the most part the viral component. In fact, this component 
    may be greater in number and diversity than the bacterial component itself. 
    Viruses are present in any environment where a potential host is found and 
    their predation dynamics, lytic or lysogenic cycles can have important 
    consequences on the dynamics and behavior of the community in general. The 
    study and characterization of the relationships between viruses (with 
    bacterial or eukaryotic hosts) and their diverse implications in the 
    community and therefore their consequences in the health of the human host, 
    are an important objective of the group's research.

    With the emergence of new DNA sequencing techniques, the study of different 
    environmental viral communities has been boosted, which has led us to 
    realize that we know less than 1% of the global viral diversity. It is common 
    in the different studies carried out on viral communities that the vast 
    majority (80% on average) of the data remain unanalyzed because they do not 
    have significant similarity to reference viruses (being the comparison with 
    reference databases the main tool for analysis). Although massive sequencing 
    techniques have boosted the number of (short) sequences of viral origin 
    deposited in databases, sequencing of complete viral genomes has been limited, 
    causing reference databases to stagnate in size. This makes it imperative to 
    develop bioinformatics tools that allow us to better discover and characterize 
    this viral diversity and unravel the full potential that these genomes are 
    encoding. An important line of research in the group is to develop such tools 
    adapted to modern sequencing technologies and state-of-the-art computational 
    tools currently available.
